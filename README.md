#### Computer Graphics using python

### Key Features:
1. **Red Ball Animation**:
   - A red ball is drawn using the `ball()` function.
   - The ball moves across the screen diagonally, simulating a bouncing or rolling effect.

2. **Line through the Ball**:
   - A line rotates through the ball, giving the appearance of a dynamic axis.

3. **Green Base**:
   - A green polygon serves as a ground or base beneath the ball.

4. **Animation**:
   - The ball moves and interacts with the screen edges, with smooth updates to its position and rotation angle over time.

### Code Analysis:

#### Functions:
1. **`ball(x, y, r)`**:
   - Draws a circle centered at `(x, y)` with radius `r` using the `GL_TRIANGLE_FAN` method.

2. **`line(x, y, r)`**:
   - Draws a line through the center of the ball, using trigonometric functions to calculate its endpoints.

3. **`base()`**:
   - Renders a polygonal green base that stretches across part of the screen.

4. **`draw()`**:
   - Clears the screen and renders all components:
     - The ball in red.
     - The rotating line in black.
     - The base in green.

5. **`animate(n)`**:
   - Updates the ball's position (`x` and `y`) and the rotation angle (`t`).
   - Ensures the ball "wraps around" horizontally and adjusts its vertical position smoothly.

6. **`main()`**:
   - Initializes the OpenGL window and sets up rendering configurations:
     - Window size, color, and 2D orthogonal projection.
   - Starts the GLUT main loop for continuous rendering and animation.

### Observations:
1. **Animation Smoothness**:
   - The ball's movement is smooth, with position updates managed by the `animate()` function using a timer (`glutTimerFunc`).

2. **Coordinate System**:
   - The `gluOrtho2D(-win, win, -win, win)` function sets up a coordinate system centered at `(0, 0)` with dimensions `1000x1000`.

3. **Performance**:
   - The `glutTimerFunc(1, animate, 1)` ensures high-frequency updates, which may impact performance on some systems.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The use of `x-=--r*cos(t)` in the `line()` function is unclear and might be a typo. It likely means `x - r*cos(t)`.
   - The ball "teleports" when it goes off-screen, which could be made smoother by simulating bouncing or looping behavior.

### Enhancements:
1. **Add Physics**:
   - Simulate gravity for a more realistic bouncing effect when the ball hits the ground.

2. **Improve Line Rotation**:
   - Add smoother and consistent rotation by normalizing `t` to a range like `[0, 2*pi]`.

3. **Better Boundary Interaction**:
   - Let the ball bounce off edges instead of resetting its position abruptly.

4. **Dynamic Speed**:
   - Introduce acceleration or deceleration for the ball's movement.
